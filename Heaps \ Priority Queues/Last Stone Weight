Q) 1046 ---> Last Stone Weight


You are given an array of integers stones where stones[i] is the weight of the ith stone.

We are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose the heaviest two stones and smash them together. 
Suppose the heaviest two stones have weights x and y with x <= y. The result of this smash is:

If x == y, both stones are destroyed, and
If x != y, the stone of weight x is destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y - x.

At the end of the game, there is at most one stone left.

Return the weight of the last remaining stone. If there are no stones left, return 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: stones = [2,7,4,1,8,1]
Output: 1



//CODE



class Solution {
    public int lastStoneWeight(int[] stones) {
      
      PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder());
      
        for(int i : stones){
            pq.add(i);
        }
        
        while(pq.size() > 1){

            int x = pq.poll(); 
            int y = pq.poll(); 
            int res = x - y; 
            pq.add(res);

        }
        
        if(pq.size() == 1){
            return pq.poll();
        }

        return 0;

        
    }
}
